## Note
This repo is in Vietnamese, so go ahead for grab Google Translate

This is the modified source code from original source code, with some intergrated hence why the branch named unofficial, the original source code is in the search due to the site where provided the original one gone, meanwhile i can only provide this one, in case the original found, another branch will be release

I do not code anything from this repo, this repo is like a backup repo, as there's no repo about this, i will not receive pull request and issue but appreciate to fork 

Due to the extremely outdated code, media player will not functioning in Google Chrome as well as every Chromium based browser and Mozila Firefox, but Internet Explorer will be work(in theory, every IE should be fine)

Please test it at your own risk (recommended localhost), as the code is outdated, many security vulnerable will be occurred

As always credit to RedPhoenix89 for making this
