## Note
This is the modified source code from original source code, with some intergrated, the original source code is in the search, meanwhile i can only provide this one

I do not code anything from this repo, this repo is like a backup repo, as there's no repo about this, i will not receive pull request and issue

Due to the extremely outdated code, Google Chrome (or any Chromium based browser), Mozila Firefox will not work for the media player
Recommended using Internet Explorer (in theory, every IE should be fine)

Please test it at your own risk, as the code is outdated, many security vulnerable will be occurred
